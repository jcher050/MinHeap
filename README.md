 A college assignment to write a method replaceKey in the MinHeap class with the  following signature: public void replaceKey(Integer oldKey, Integer newKey) The method will replace the first occurrence of oldKey with the newKey, and  restore the Min-Heap property after the change. If the oldKey does not exist in  the heap, the method prints an appropriate message and returns without changing  the heap..
